# R-function-for-data-analysis-and-model-fitting

This R function was develpoed to do following tasks, 

a.Identify qualitative and quantitative variables in the dataset.
b. Count the missing values in each variable.
Impute the missing values using:
i. the mean value of the variable if it is numeric.
ii. the mode of the variable if it is categorical.

c. Identify univariate outliers for each numeric variable. 
d. Summarize each variable using a proper visualization tool for the respective 
variable (eg: histogram, boxplot etc.).
e. When the response variable is specified as an argument, it should run the best 
predictive model for that response category (consider only continuous and binary 
response variables) and select features considering all other meaningful 
variables. 
f. print relevant diagnostic metrics and plots for the 
selected model
